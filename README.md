# Influit
Social Network for Influencers

Influit is a marketplace for influencers to share ideas, tips, tricks, advice, etc. Influencers use this community to better their influencer marketing skills, while product developers and businesses use this network for recruitment purposes and strategies. Marketing platform companies essentially act as intermediaries on a single platform. 

It is a thread-based platform consisting of forums, blogs, and posts in which up-voted answers rise to the top. 

This social network hasn't been fully developed - the website was created with the aid of an HTML template (Twenty by HTML Up) and the initial backend for the posting functionality has been created. 

Below is the user experience workflow:

Future functionalities to be added:
Collaboration functionality: microblogging, social feed building, activity stream
IM Functionality: sending personal messages to other users
Integration: among all social media platforms (Quora post can be posted on Influit)
Social task management solutions: calendar, reminders, goals, deadlines, etc.
Shareoholic API: tracks social media metrics and displays on dashboard - live display
Story platform: read or write on any device

The Bottom Line: 1) Influit captures the growing influencer community; 2) All parties can increase revenue; 3) Connections matter.
